This is a short course, which is conducted by me for free, to the undergraduate students of the Department of Statistics and Insurance Science. 
It started as what I would like to see as a 1st-year undergraduate student, while I was hearing about Data Science and Machine Learning.
The main target in to introduce basic concepts of Linear Algebra, Calculus, Python/R and step by step use them in order to understand
